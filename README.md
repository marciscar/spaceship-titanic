# Spaceship Titanic - A Kaggle ML Project

This repository contains my solution to the [Spaceship Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) on Kaggle.  
The goal is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension using the information provided in the dataset.
