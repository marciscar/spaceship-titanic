    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - _PassengerId_ - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form _gggg_pp_ where _gggg_ indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and _pp_ is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - _HomePlanet_ - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - _CryoSleep_ - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - _Cabin_ - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form _deck/num/side_, where side can be either _P_ for Port or _S_ for Starboard.\n",

    "    - _Destination_ - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\n",

    "    - _Name_ - The first and last names of the passenger.\n",

    "- __sample_submission.csv__ - A submission file in the correct format.\n",
